# Final-Project
My final project for my third year at university. Link to the accompanying blog detailing progress on the project: https://oliverchamberlainfinalproject.wordpress.com/


The build folder contains an executable for the project. Most debugging tools are unavailable in the executable because they depend on Unity's Gizmo system.

Unity project dependencies:
Unity 2017.1
