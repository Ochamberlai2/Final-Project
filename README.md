# Final-Project- Oliver Chamberlain S179650
My final project for my third year at university. Link to the accompanying blog detailing progress on the project: https://oliverchamberlainfinalproject.wordpress.com/

## How to access the scenes folder of the project
Open the "Oliver - Chamberlain - final - project" file, navigate to assets -> artificial potential field pathfinding -> scenes.

## Important

The build folder contains an executable for the project. Most debugging tools are unavailable in the executable because they depend on Unity's Gizmo system.

## Depenencies

Unity 2017.1

## Instructions
To send a move order to the group, first select the group that you wish to order from the central menu at the top of the screen and left click anywhere in the game world.
